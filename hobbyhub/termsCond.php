All Payment Methods will be posted on the Site along with any associated fees or charges, which we may update from time to time at our sole discretion.

 4.1. Straight Pricing
We will charge you a Service Fee based on the minimum Freelancer Fees collected by you          from your Client (less any refunds or reversals) for the duration of your relationship with your Client. The client needs to pay 40% of the minimum amount charged by the freelancer to get in touch with them and start the work.

When the client makes the advance payment and the Freelancer accepts the order, the order goes live. After the service/product is received by the clients, they must visit their account and select the ‘Complete Order’ button in order to finish the order. When it is done the order is considered finished and the advance paid by the clients is delivered to the freelancers account within 10 working days.
