<h4>WHERE DID IT BEGIN?</h4>



<p>When the founder, Nikunj Bagaria a resident of Guwahati faced difficulty in finding freelancers within the city, he started thinking of a solution. A little research and discussion about it with people helped him find out that not only the customers strive to get a service but even freelancers find it difficult to find customers. Right after that, the idea was discovered and HobbyHub was developed. Now we have a definite place where people can find all they need and freelancers don&#8217;t have to worry about exposure.</p>
